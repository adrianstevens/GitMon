\# GitMon â€” GitHub Pull Request Review Monitor



GitMon is a lightweight .NET 8 console tool that scans all repositories in a GitHub organization and reports on \*\*Pull Request review activity\*\*.  



It answers questions like:

\- How many PRs were merged without any review?

\- How many had only comments vs formal approvals?

\- What percentage of PRs were reviewed in the last week?



It produces:

\- A \*\*per-repo summary\*\* (counts + percentages)

\- A \*\*CSV export\*\* for further analysis

\- A \*\*list of PRs merged without reviews\*\* (coming soon)
